# Crowdfunding-ETL
 Module 8: ETL - eExtract, Transform, Load

## Purpose

Use Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, extract and transform the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file, followed by the load phase. Specifically, use the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. And, upload the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. Finally, perform a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.

## Deliverables

This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables as following:

- Deliverable 1: Extract Data
- Deliverable 2: Transform and Clean Data
- Deliverable 3: Create an ERD and Table Schema, and Load Data
- Deliverable 4: SQL Analysis
